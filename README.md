# Starting the application
First, you have to install some lib's
* Simple DirectMedia Layer development files
```

```
* Image loading library for Simple DirectMedia Layer 2, development files
```
$ (sudo) apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev
```
* Mixer library for Simple DirectMedia Layer 2, development files
```
$ (sudo) apt-get install libsdl2-mixer-dev
```
* Clone the repository to your pc
```
$ git clone git@github.com:digalandig-tecprog/DigAlanDig_TecProg.git && cd DigAlanDig_TecProg
```
* Now your machine is able to run the application. The next command is very simple
```
$ make
